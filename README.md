# Restaurant-filterer
Simple filterer, takes data from a JSON database and gives results. The database i used was Yelp's so my program is strucutred around the attributes in their database
It filters from State and then gives the best restuarant in the area acccording to ratings and reviews.
It also sorts by the ambience or vibe of the restaurant and can return the most reviewed restaurants by query.
